# Caesar Cipher - Encryption and Decryption

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a given number.

## Features:
- Encrypt messages by shifting letters of the alphabet.
- Decrypt messages by reversing the shift.
- The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and ignores spaces, punctuation, and special characters.

## Usage:

1. **Run the program** in a Python environment.
2. **Choose the encryption or decryption option**.
3. **Enter the message** you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. **Provide the shift number**, which determines how much the alphabet is shifted.

### Example:

- **Encrypting** the message "hello" with a shift of 3 will result in **"khoor"**.
- **Decrypting** the message "khoor" with a shift of 3 will return the original message **"hello"**.
